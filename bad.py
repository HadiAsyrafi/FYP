txt[0]='''I walked into this movie with pretty low expectations. I didn't expect something as good as the cartoon, I didn't expect a perfect adaptation. I expected some glitzy action sequences, cheap emotional ploys, just some fun summer fair.

What did I get? A movie so indescribably horrible I can only shake my head in bewilderment. Believe the critics. The writing sucks, the acting is stiff, the pacing clumsy, the 3-D beyond bad, the overall tone way too dark and brooding. Not much here is salvageable.

Obviously Shyamalan got completely caught up in the mythology of the world and missed the fact that what made the original cartoon so great were the CHARACTERS. Of which there are none in this film.

But really, even just a competently produced film would have been nice. And it almost was. The music was great. The special effects looked amazing, I don't care what anyone says. The fighting was cool. The sets were adequately spectacular. Indeed, it appears the only one who didn't show up for work was Shyamalan. While the adult actors manage to find their way somewhat on their own, the poor kids are obviously lost without someone competently leading them, they spend most of the film in a bewildered daze. Even some of the background extras acted awkwardly. But of course, there are no real survivors of Shyamalan's CLUNKER of a script. I can't believe someone didn't stop this guy. There were maybe two scenes that didn't sound awkward, and they had no dialog. I don't think any film has ever been such a disaster due to one man's gross ineptitude.'''

txt[1]='''The only thing I can really say about The Last Airbender is this: Epic Fail. Just how epic? Paramount Pictures gave M. Night Shyamalan $150 million dollars to adapt the popular Nickolodeon cartoon for the big screen. What they got is an absolute mess of a movie, complete with poor acting, the most hackneyed script ever, and a last-minute conversion to 3-D that only serves to destroys what was possibly some lush cinematography. The Last Airbender is perhaps the worst film of the summer, a feat I thought Jonah Hex had locked down. However, Airbender makes a determined effort. Let me put it this way, as good as Toy Story 3 was, Airbender is just as bad. It was hard to find anything wrong with Toy Story 3. It is nigh impossible to find anything right with Airbender. The story is ridiculously complex. In a world where people can manipulate (bend) the four elements of air, earth, fire and water, depending on their tribal affiliation, there exists a being (the Avatar) who can manipulate all four. This person is also the sole being capable of communing the the "spirit world" which serves to keep things in balance. This being went missing 100 years ago, only to be found in a giant ice sphere by two children of the water tribe. In the 100 years the Avatar has been gone, the Fire tribe has begun conquering the others, though we're never really told why. The disgraced Prince Zuko(Dev Patel, the Slumdog Millionaire himself) of the Fire tribe wants to the Avatar so he can return to his family. The Water children need to save the Avatar to ensure the Fire people don't win. For this point on it becomes to silly to try and summarize. Shyamalan succumbs to his own hubris, loading the film with long, boring exposition communicated through long, boring speeches that I'm sure were meant to be inspirational. Instead they are clich√©d, burdensome mounds of words that only slow down an already languidly paced film. He heaps some unnecessary narration on top of the exposition, condescending to the audience as he does it. Perhaps the narration was put in to help the film's target audience, the prepubescent b0ys and girls who watch the cartoon, understand where this convoluted story is going. Sadly, it doesn't. The dialogue is so corny, it left me squirming a little. Also bothersome is the ham-fisted way Shyamalan expounded his themes, which seem to be responsibility, responsibility, and the horror of industry destroying nature (lifted with little change from the Lord of the Rings). Seriously, the Fire people sail their world's oceans in giant steel yachts that feature gigantic smokestacks over visible flame. These stacks spew out a never ending cloud of dark, ashy smoke. The metaphor could not be more clear had it just been printed as a subtitle across the screen. The acting is bad across the board. The child cast as Aan, the Avatar, Noah Ringer, a wooden child actor if there ever was one. He speaks his lines as if reciting them of a cue card just off screen. The two Water tribe children, Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) are no better. A colleague of mine I saw the film with noted that Rathbone seemed downright anxious every time he was on screen, delivering his lines tersely, with little emotion. The older actors just phone it in. The usually reliable Cliff Curtis looks bored stiff as the leader of the Fire people, while the main antagonist, a Fire general played by Aasif Mandvi, is neither menacing nor scary. He comes off as a schoolyard bully, all bluster and no balls. The only actor I found brought any sort of depth to his role was Shaun Toub (Yinsen from Iron Man). Playing Prince Zuko's Uncle Iroh, he's conflicted between his duty to the prince and his beliefs in the spirit world, something the Fire people have come to consider children's superstition. Perhaps the most egregious error of the movie is the 3-D conversion. 3-D tends to suck all the light out of the images it portends to display, leaving viewers with a murky picture where shadow and light blend together. There are no crisp lines in the film, no real detail. Which is a shame, as the film's setting should've been its biggest strength. The movie travels from an arctic campsite, where the whites should have popped against the bluish hues of the ice and water around it. When it travels to warmer climates, the greens and browns should have been awe-inspiring. It's not. It all looks faded. Much as with Clash of the Titans, the 3-D is barely noticeable throughout the film, and contributes nothing. I fear that Hollywood has cynically latched onto this fad for the high ticket price it commands rather than for any real artistic merit. My only relief was the movie was short, so I didn't get the usual headache 3-D movies tend to give me. I didn't expect much going into The Last Airbender. However, I didn't expect it to be quite so bad. It's like watching a train wreck unfold over 94 minutes. The problem is, that 94 minutes feels like an eternity. The end of the film hints at a sequel. I hope some divine being takes mercy on us all and never lets that happen.'''

txt[2]='''The movie was probably one of the worst remakes of my life. They left out 14 episodes out of 20. Haru seems to be a 4 year old boy who appears for about 2 minutes and has almost no lines. The other characters such as Suki, Bumi, Bato, and Jet are not introduced. It goes too fast. From the water tribe, Aang and his gang go straight to the imprisoned episode which combines with another episode The Waterbending Scroll, and the Air Temples are mixed up. To people who do not watch the series it could be extremely confusing. All in all, skip it. The TV show was clearly written out and planned and everything for M. Night to make it a movie, but he even butchered up an already written movie. '''

txt[3]='''M.Night.Shyamalan ought to be ashamed of himself. I went to the midnight premier of the Last Airbender as a hopeful long time fan of the wonderful animated series. Less than thirty minutes into the feature however I realized that my hopes would be dead on the ground by the time the movie ended.

Over the past few months this film has been surrounded by controversy. The casting choices have caused accusations of racism to be leveled and many fans were left feeling disappointed months before the film even premiered. Now, I don't think M.Night Shyamalan is a racist. I don't know him well enough to make such a slanderous claim. Would I have preferred that the characters in the movie had appeared as the fans had come to know them over the past five years? Of course. However at the heart of Avatar fans, I don't think changing the appearances of certain nations was a racial issue. Simply put, I think people just wanted the characters to look the way they were supposed to look. However, had this movie been written well and had the acting been terrific, changing the appearances of the nations wouldn't have mattered. Because at its heart the story of Avatar is a human story with strong themes of redemption and forgiveness. I think people would have been able to look past their disgruntlement and see the beauty of the story. That is, if the movie had been well written. And I'm sorry to say, it was not.

Naturally, it was always going to be difficult to condense over eight hours worth of animated material into two-hours of movie. How do you choose what goes and what stays in a series where almost everything is interconnected? It was a daunting task indeed. But successful adaption of books, television series, and even video games have been done before. If the works of Tolkien, the master of intricate detail, could be adapted into a series that left a decent amount of his life long fans pleased, surely Avatar: The Last Airbender could be adapted with the same success. Unfortunately, this adaption was far from successful. In fact I think this movie officially joins the list of the most atrocious film adaptions, right along side of the horrendous Earthsea mini-series, the painful Eragon flop, and perhaps the even worse Dark is Rising catastrophe.

So where did this movie go wrong? The better question would be: where didn't it go wrong? The writing was horrendous. High school freshmen could probably manage to come up with a better screenplay. I'm not sure who gave Shyamalan permission to write this film, but whoever it was needs to formally apologize to the fans and to the people who wasted their money hoping to see something worthwhile. The direction was choppy‚Äîcertain scenes made little sense, the camera lingered on other similarly senseless scenes, and at times the camera angles were difficult to follow. The lighting in the film was too dark throughout and when color was added, it was in too much excess. Overall, there was a lack of balance and cohesion in the way this movie was filmed. The plot was a mess. People who weren't familiar with the series would have been left lost, and people who were familiar with the series were left confused. Certain characters that were supposed to do things didn't, lines weren't said when they should have been said, and elements of the plot were just erased entirely. There was no Avatar Roku, only a dragon spirit that may have been an attempt at Fang, but a very bad one. There was no Omashu, no Kiyoshi warriors, there were no refugees at the northern air temple and Aang never attempted to master fire bending. In fact, in the movie he was too timid to learn water bending, which fans know to be a fallacy. And the characters that were featured were not only acted and written poorly, but many of them modeled new pronunciations of their names. I'm not sure of the reasoning behind this. Perhaps the changes in pronunciation were more accurate. Even if that was the case, they never should have strayed from the pronunciations in the series. Fans grew accustomed to a certain way of a saying and hearing a name. To change the pronunciations only led to confusion and distastes. I heard many people in the theatre around me growling in frustration every time Aang was pronounced "Ah-ng".

I won't get into my dislike of the graphics in detail. Appa and Momo were fairly horrendous, the bending was decent but done incorrectly(actors had to make a hell of a lot of movement for anything to happen, whereas in the series each movement corresponds to the movement of the elements), and the 3D was pointless.

Overall, I'd give this movie a 0 out of 10. Fans of the series, don't waste your money. People who are not fans and areconsidering giving this film a chance, use the money you would have spent on the ticket to rent the first season at the nearest video store. '''

txt[4]=''' I went into the movie knowing it would not be even a fraction as good as the real show. However, I didn't know that would make me literally want to leave the theater in the middle of the very movie. How someone could do such damage in approximately an hour and forty minutes is entirely beyond me. It was ridiculous, the only way to describe it is a $150 million dollar failure. I could understand if the effects were not up to par but the biggest disappointment was the acting. It was so stiff and it never once felt like the actors meant a word they were saying. I caught a glimpse of an interview with Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone on TV and even their approach to that felt so wrong. It felt kind of disgusting to see as I've lately been watching Avatar: The Last Airbender (with extras) almost religiously for the past month.

The script in itself should have been tossed into the garbage and burnt and it's remains locked away so that no one would ever have to suffer looking at such garbage. That's why I'm not really sure if it's the actors or the script that's really to blame for the atrocious "movie" that's resulted. The long and, I'm assuming this what they were going for, "inspirational" speeches merely consisted of crudely strung together clich√©s and the language left much to be desired. I found myself almost twitching at the phrase (something along the lines) "You guys are AWESOME people!"...

What I find the be so incredibly amazing is how someone could honestly fail to such a proportion when they literally have a blue print already created. The fans know how the characters look and sound and while I understand that no one fits the package perfectly one out of two would be better than nothing. As well, suddenly deciding to change the pronunciation of the characters name is definitely not the best idea, while I do understand that he wanted the names to sound like their Asian origin, it didn't go over well and the whole time I was just cringing at the mere mention of Aang and Sokka's names.

This movie does not hold a candle to the original show. Heck, it should be retitled as it is hardly resembles the original in any way shape or form. While I do realize that not all episodes can be featured, the sequence of events just left you feeling awkward and confused. I, also, loathed the way they worked the bending in like it took five minutes of moving ones hands around awkwardly before any actual bending occurred. Most of the fighting was like fifteen minutes of martial arts with like the occasional bit of air bending and a little water being splashed around.

There was nothing to love in this movie not even the most adorable of characters such as Momo. Momo had literally what three minutes in the entire movie which I found extremely depressing as Momo was always one of the characters I just wanted to cuddle because of his adorable mannerisms but in the movie I had no love for the digitized Momo. Not even Appa was interesting.

This movie leaves me hoping and praying that M. Night Shyamalan goes broke and is black listed so that he can't ruin the series even more so. This is definitely something you will spend some time just trying to forget.
'''

txt[5]='''First off... Did M. Night Shyamalan even watch the Avatar series on TV? Or take a glance at it? Also, Dante Basco, the original voice actor said that he would be interested in playing Zuko, but they made the cast predominantly white. The show was based in Asia, how do you screw that up? It was White people, Arabic people, and Hispanics.. Now, there is nothing wrong with any of those ethnicities (I'm white) but, none of them looked Asian. If you have seen the series, you'll hate it, if you haven't seen the series, the lack of plot line and the anti-climatic story will make you hate it even more: seeing as how you won't understand what you just watched for almost 2 hours.

This movie was horrible. Don't waste your time. M. Night Shyamalan re- wrote the movie, it wasn't even funny... it's a waste of time.

I hope he paid the actors well, because they had to do a really crappy job for him. '''

txt[6]='''You know there is something wrong when there is more back-story than actual dialogue.

As someone who has personally watched both the original series, as well as is someone who staying with the current post-series (as per this review, season 4, episode 5,) there does not seem to be something here for either the fans of the series or others, even with the white-washing of the acting aside.

Why it wouldn't appeal to fans: They got the four fighting styles/bending methods all wrong. People do random movement and boom something shows up. The purpose of the system is to convey the various forms of eastern martial arts, not air karate. For example, when an earth bender pushes to the right, rocks go that way. he doesn't do 50 movements and something shows up. It looks silly Pronunciation of the names (I don't mind translating a name to the traditional name, just translate all of them, or use actors who actually sound like they would speak said language.) Fire bending requires outside fire to be usable. The major point of fire-bending is that it comes from the heart and the body. How can later movies been made if characters couldn't communicate that the will was the problem with fire-bending? It leaves a massive plot hole. How could the air nation have been invaded without massive amounts of fire being there (which there isn't? The avoidance of major characters from the show, among others the Kioshi warriors (who serve a major plot point later.) They concentrate the movie on 5-6 episodes.

Why it wouldn't appeal to others: The movie itself is devoid of a lot of action and what isn't shown is conveyed in both a meaningless and boring way.

There is more back-story than actual viewable plot.

3D is bad, the general graphics are bad as well. '''

txt[7]=''' despise this film. Basically that's the gist of this review. I adore the source material so I may be considered biased, however I have watched this from non-fans of the show and the reaction was similar. Not a single element in this mess works, not a single idea comes to fruition. So let's begin the burning.

The acting is atrocious. I cannot come up with any adjectives to properly describe how bad it is. It feels like a school play, or an April fools prank. Lines are delivered with no conviction, emotion or confidence and there is almost never any expression Only Dev Patel is able to maintain some dignity in this, and even he would be considered mediocre in any competent film. All the personality and depth found in the performances found in the show are totally nonexistent here.

Next, the unbelievably asinine writing. This is likely worse than the acting, and is frankly an insult on three levels:

1. To any fan of the show, its writing, its universe or its characters.

2. To any fan of film who has ever enjoys a written piece of dialogue.

3. To any human who has ever held a conversation or read a written word.

Wooden, clunky and lacking any flavour or personality. The leaden exposition turns a magical and enchanting universe into a grey prison cell for creativity. It feels like the script has leeched every spec of power, fun or depth found in the source material. It isn't even funny, its infuriating and brain numbing. The acting in this film sucks, however I feel sorry for any actor who had to read these lines.

Furthermore, the visuals are pathetic. The effects are horribly outdated and limit the awe inspiring visuals and action of the show into becoming a crappy video game. No size, no weight, no impact. The worst that CGI has to offer. The production design is cheap and tacky, again wringing all the majesty of the show out and leaving a wilted husk behind. The same applies to the costume and make-up, which is probably even weaker due to some particular offences (Zuko's scar is barely noticeable, turning his 'horrific disfigurement' into a slight crease and reddening).

I could go into the changes from the show, and other such issues from the perspective of a fan, but that's not the point. This is not a complaint from the perspective of a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, or a film fan. This is from a person who has common sense and standards. This is an insulting piece of filth that showcases pretty much everything that can possibly go wrong when making a film. I don't believe in calling films 'evil' or 'dangerous' but this wreck might be the exception. I dare anyone to offer a hint of praise to this, thing. '''

txt[8]='''This dreadful mess is the latest in an ever increasing parade of movies that spit on the audience. It's time for movie makers to stop thoughtlessly churning out this kind of useless stuff, and provide a better product for our entertainment dollars.

How could they goof this up so badly? Just a kid's show adapted to a movie: simple to appeal to the established audience, with the added plus of the similarly themed Avatar's recent success, right? Try infusing the source material with ineptitude and lack of vision, and this film is the result. The direction from the once promising director M. Night shows us nothing. Characters are neither developed nor interesting, the aimless story is not threaded in any cohesive manner, the acting is abysmal, and the cinematography is ugly and fake. I've seen better looking gang tags in the inner city, than this movie's so-called 3-D. The make-up used is cheaper than a kindergarten Halloween play.

No sequels, please. Let this really be the "last" of its kind. '''

txt[11]='''SPOILER WARNING Lets start off with a positive side of the movie. It follows the series very well, and the special effects are very good.

That is about the only good thing I can say about this movie.

The actors were terrible in this movie. Not only could they not act, they also didn't portray the characters from the series very well, Prince Zuko being a prime example. The thing that really annoyed me was the relationship between Sokka and Princess Yue. It was so unrealistic and unbearable to watch. SPOILER: For example, at the end of the movie when Princess Yue is sacrificing herself for the moon spirit, it is meant to be sad. It isn't. Not even at the slightest bit. I honestly think that M. Night Shyamalan purposely made it this bad for the kiddos, because the 8 year old girl that I went with really liked it.

Lets end this review on a positive note. Uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub) was the star of this film. He had great acting and played his part perfect.'''

txt[12]='''"The Ring" movies were subject to a lot of parody, but at least most people have fond memories of them. Well, the original at least. There's more than a ten year gap between these sequels and it's gotten to the point where nobody cares about these movies anymore. The main flaws are that this story makes no sense and everything is pointless. The film starts off with a guy being killed a week after seeing the video obviously. The weird thing is that it takes place on a plane, meaning that Samara kills everyone onboard. How did she become that powerful? How was she able to influence people that didn't watch the video?

Well, we then cut to a garage sale where we see the video two years later. So this is going to introduce to us the main characters, right? No, this setting never appears again and after a 2 year time span, we get the title of the movie. Seriously, you can skip the first eight minutes...or the whole film for that matter. The movie mostly suffers from being ridiculously boring. Everyone is mostly just talking and none of the story follows any logical sense. The film tries to give us more of the mythology behind the video as it introduces us to Samara's biological father.

He's blind so that he can't see the video. The movie ends with her killing him which is said to free her soul. Somehow, her presence gave him the ability to see again so she could kill him. The main character also gets a mark on her hand that's in Braille. They explicitly mention this earlier in the film, but don't try to translate it until the very end. Yes, they just ignore it before they try to get rid of the main problem. Guess what? Samara hasn't been defeated and now she's becoming more powerful than ever. Yeah, I guess she was just messing with everyone before. Then the main character throws up hair that turns into a fly meaning Samara is possessing her. It's that stupid. * '''

txt[13]='''Saw this film last night, trailer made it look like a return to form after the rubbish Ring 2 (2005) which was terrible. However I genuinely think Rings is worse. The film follows girlfriend and boyfriend Julia and Holt as they try to work out Samara's history so she they can set her free and also free Julia from the cursed videotape. Also there's a pointless subplot about a group of college students dedicated to analysing the videotape. This film started off interesting but it gradually get's worse and really boring, literally nothing happens it's just people talking, doing mundane things and giving exposition, honestly I can say there were only about 2 properly good sections: Samara's first proper appearance is cool and then the end 15 mins or so of the film. Samara is barely in this film and she isn't even scary because she is badly CGI'd and does nothing at all apart from crawl around and stare neither are jump scares also don't work which is bad because this is the only scare tactic the film has going for it. Also another reason I had hopes for this is because it has two well established good actors in it: Johnny Galecki (The Big Bang Theory) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Daredevil Series, Jurassic World, The Magnificent Seven), Galecki plays a sarcastic miserable professor, I'm guessing he was in the right frame of mind then because he looks and sounds bored throughout and D'Onofrio plays a blind gravekeeper/priest who is actually more menacing than Samara and is the most interesting character in the film which is irritating because he only shows up in the last 30 mins or so. Don't bother with this its an insult to the original Ringu films and the 2002 US version The Ring. '''

Visually the movie is great. That's where it ends. The writing was so simplistic and terrible that I was personally offended. The acting was just south of god awful and the storyline was non-existent. The acting was phoned in by every actor on screen and I felt myself laughing at moments I knew were not meant to be funny. And I understand using pauses for dramatic effect, but there was way too many and they were just awkwardly long, it made me fell like the actors forgot their lines and they said screw it when it came time to edit.

After train-wrecks like Lady in the Water, The Village, and The Happening who is the idiot that keeps green lighting his films?! Why did nickelodeon waste its time and resources on a terrible director like this? This had the potential to be THE summer blockbuster but instead it was the single worst movie I've seen Nickolodeon put their name one (and let's remember, I grew up on movies like Good Burger) and besides The Happening, this was M. Night's biggest insult to movie lovers.

There is gonna be at least 2 more installments to this disappointing series and if they hope to salvage anything, they need a new director and an acting coach.

To add on to the inaccuracy Uncle Iroh is supposed to be a short chubby man with gray shoulder length hair with some pulled into a ponytail the actor had dark hair more waist length, he was also tall and thin, Zuko (another mispronounced name in the movie) had about 3 different pronunciations throughout the movie, and instead of the traditional fire nation ponytail with all hair around it shaved he had a crew cut! Me and my friends were extremely horrified at the inaccuracy of this movie! '''

txt[17]='''If you are wanting to see this movie then I would suggest going to see another movie. I felt like I wasted my time and money on seeing this film. I felt like monkeys could have done a better job then this clown that made thus 150 million dollar film.

I apologize now for my spelling for the names First off in the first part of the movie the screwed up. The first they show Anng or Ohng (They total did not say there names right) he was was in the Ice but when he got out he did not needed to be cared out or even helped out. Also he was not this shy confused little boy that was having a hard time with water bending.

Then next thing is when they first go to a earth village it was suppose to be Kiyoshi Island but instead they skip that part and go to where Katara get all of them arrested and they put all of them in the middle of nowhere in a mountain, NOT A SHIP BUT A MOUNTAIN. Then you have Anng give Katara's speech and then they you see them beat the Fire Benders then cross the gates that held them and then walk into the village that is no more than 5 feet away from the gates. Then the Show the Statue of Kiyoshi.

They give Anng a water Bending scroll that Katara was suppose to steal and they show him having trouble Water Bending. He Never had Trouble with water bending it was earth that he was having trouble with. Then they show a bunch of scenes that showed the country and Anng then wanting to go to the Northern Air temple. They skip the part where Katara and Soka had been sick and where he need to get the frozen frogs to get them better. Instead they have get arrested at the Northern Air Temple not from a refugee but from a Fire Bender Spy. Really?? a Spy?? They kinda got blue Sprite right. He does save Anng but Anng does not try to leave him in the middle of battle.

After that they blow Zooku up and move in to invasion for the Northern Water tribe. Master Paco never fights Katara and the place is ruled by the princess and Soka does not volunteer to protect her but was order to. Also he does not help out with the planning of how to fend off the Fire Nation. That is another thing Tough out this whole movie the Fire Bender ALWAYS HAD USE FIRE THAT WAS THERE AND NOT THERE OWN FIRE, AND WHEN IRHO DID THEY WHERE AFRAID OF IT. They never USED a TORCH or a Fire Pit to Create FIRE!! They Total Messed that part up for the benders.

Zhoul also does not die in the first Book and he also fights Zooku. Oh also Zhoul, and Zooku does not have there fight when they pull into port because they show them while they are out to sea when they meet.

I would strong advise any one that loved the series not to see this movie because they would not like it. Within the first five minutes for the film I wanted shoot myself on how it was. There was no plot in the film and did not make any sense. It was kinda like watching Dragonball but worse. They got nothing right about the movie.

Also instead of having Anng Master the Element by summer's end they give Anng three years to Master the elements because that is when Sozan's Comet arrives. '''

txt[18]='''This review is spoiler free

The only good thing about this movie is that six months ago when I seen the teaser trailer it inspired me to take a look at the animated show. I was hooked immediately and have become a total avatar freak watching every episode at least three times. Then the more I seen of this movie in commercials the more I worried, but still hoping for the best I purchased tickets several weeks ago for a midnight preview with eager anticipation. I wore my favorite avatar t shirt and went to the theatre three hours early.

I was so disappointed in this movie that after the first hour I could not take any more and got up and left. It was not just that things were different from the show but the story itself had actually mutated into something completely different, and not in a good way. I feel like the spirit of the show was totally missing. there was no fun at all, no shipping, and the action was not exciting.

Avatar fans do yourself a favor and skip this one, stay home and put in the season one DVD instead, and I am certain a better time will be had by all. '''

txt[19]='''I had only seen one episode of the Avatar cartoon. Only one. From what I saw, it looked like Americans trying to get rich on making stuff look like anime. So, I went into this movie with absolutely no expectations. None-what-so-ever. And, while I expected the girls cosplaying, painting blue arrows on their head, and sticking blue masking tape on their arm to be the worst site of the night, what I saw in the movie theater made everything earlier pale in comparison.

So, let me just delve into the plot. We have two characters. Both of their names are too long and ridiculous to remember; and while they're the focus of the first half of the film, they serve no plot purpose what-so-ever other than to fill time. Let's refer to them as WaterBoy and WaterGirl for the rest of this review. WaterBoy is a random teenage boy who hits things with an ice pick and despite having no actual combat experience, can beat a soldier whose been trained his whole life to fight in combat. He has a ponytail and looks like a complete dorkwad with it. Then we have his sister: Watergirl. She sucks at magic. Then, she gets better. That's the extent of her character development. But apparently because she's the only water bender from this one random tribe, she's set to accompany the most important person on Earth. That's like saying- I'm the only political scientist in Farmerville. I deserve to lead the President of the United States around by the nose.

So these two geniuses run across the Last Airbender, this movie's protagonist. His name is Un(Like UN. Get it? Because he unites the nations. Like the United Nations. But not really because the United Nations doesn't actually work). And, despite the fact that he's the most important person in the world that everyone wants captured, the Water Twins decide that they, being 12 and 13, are best suited to protect him from evil. Anyway, no one knows this guy exists, save for Prince Emo Angst the Third, who hates his father. He has no other character to him except that. In fact, this is how he starts most of his conversations: "Hello, I'm the prince. I hate my father. Nice to meet you." So since nobody in the world knows this guy is alive and despite the huge tactical advantage that gives them over their enemy, Waterboy convinces Un to take off his robe and reveal himself to some villagers. They're rightly disturbed and the Fire Army occupying the area, despite the fact that Un hasn't killed or shown the ability to kill a single one of them, decide to run away because that's what soldiers do when they encounter their most important objective. But eventually, Un gets caught. Then Prince Emoface saves him. Then he escapes Prince Emoface. Then a bunch of junk happens and they discover Un actually sucks at magic. So, they now embark on a quest to learn how to use magic.

Blah Blah Blah, he learns how to use water magic. Waterboy, despite the fact that he's got no standing, prestige, or skill as a fighter is appointed as the princess's guard. Because you know that despite the fact there are men with twenty years of combat experience in service of the nation, we're entrusting the life of a member of the royal family's care to a random stranger who just walked into town, fights with an ice pick, has no actual combat experience, looks like a dingus, could very well be a spy from the people trying to kill them, and is 13 years old. Yeah.

Meanwhile, Un and Watergirl learn how to actually use magic. Then, a bunch of fire people attack. There's a giant fight. Prince Angst McCrybaby shows up and complains about his father and how he hates him some more some more. An important military general runs past the front lines of an open battlefield into enemy territory to kill a koi fish. Un summons a giant wall of water. Blah blah blah. It's over.

Let's add insult to injury. While the plot sucks, the acting is even worse. It feels like I'm watching a sitcom or playing a video game. Character says something. Slight pause. Other character moves to face the other character, says something back. It's just plain awful. From the very beginning of the movie, you can tell it's going to be painful and you already paid too much. And as the movie goes on, the awful acting grows more apparent. People in this movie laughed at the serious scenes. They're just that bad.

Then, we have the special effects. They're good. They're hardly 3d. Are you planning to pay the extra $3 to see it in 3d? Do yourself a favor- don't. You miss nothing. Like, the extent of the 3d is a leaf falling. That's it. Like, they'll make people standing in the foreground 3d. But, they won't make various special effects sloshed throughout the thousands of Matrix scenes that way. Why? Because this movie is terrible.

Look, I could write about this movie for hours. I want to. But, I've got work in the morning. So, if you haven't gotten anything from this review, get this: Avatar iCarly with magic. I had three people that loved the cartoon series come to see this movie with me. It all hurt them on the inside. Do yourself a favor: don't see it. '''

txt[20]='''M. Night needs to have his directing license removed. He is quickly joining Michael Bay as a totally incompetent director that can only ruin a movie by touching it... He couldn't even get the actors to say Aang's name correctly! And what happened to the character of Aang? There was no joy in his rendition. Aang was portrayed as dark and humourless. No wanting to ride the backs of giant Koi, or anything that made Aang the way he was.

If you have seen the cartoon, don't subject yourself to this brutalization of a wonderful story.

If you have not seen the cartoon, skip this movie and watch the cartoon instead. M. Night seriously destroyed a charming and uplifting tale with his incompetence.

Unless the series gets another director, this is doomed. I'm not sure the series can recover from this travesty! '''

txt[21]='''...bad acting (especially from the renowned actors like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze), apparently low budget and poor execution turned it into a mere second rate sfi-fi-'horror' flick. It also tries just a little too hard to deliver its message and so tends to be somewhat over-obvious from time to time. Good concept though. Pity it wasn't managed properly. 4/10.

If you want to see something in just about the same pace but with a better performance (and probably considerably larger budget:) I would suggest 'Solaris'.
'''

txt[22]='''This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats. While making jokes, of course.

Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message, because it is again "the good guys" killing "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a storyline where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about that, with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people.

This movie only works because of the hidden Nazi-ideology underneath. It does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun, I am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me.

Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is pornography, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst.

Inglorious Basterds is a pointless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money.'''

txt[23]='''Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and Q T, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the Jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious.

'''

txt[24]='''This usually all sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) I'm hardly Tarantino's biggest fan (and will *try* not to stoop to calling him a 'hack'....which is quite hard) I don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it. So with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch 'Inglorious Basterds'

Now, to call it a 'rip-off of a rip-off' would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari's (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but not it's plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax, in that, it's dialogue is stale, and outcome signposted a mile off. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are treated to the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like B-movie king ALDO RAY....ha-ha Quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, Mr Jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking Nazi-killer. Meanwhile Mr Tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'?

Raines 'platoon' consists of (John Cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty Jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) Eli Roth (as the baseball bat wielding 'Bear Jew') The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and i'll wager more than half the QT fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)

Anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both Raine and his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the showing of a Nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)

More boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as Pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. And any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's David Bowie song in a WWII movie.

My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most Tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) I knew of Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) Ennio Morricone's haunting score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire Barad Pitt, i'll assume You (Mr Tarantino) are the main draw here? I don't want the audience directing the movie. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity....NOT how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. It's high time the fan-boys (on IMDb) employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't....the studios should?)

The tired old argument with Tarantino worshippers is "well, if you can do better...do so" Let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull QT has.....i'd want to offer YOU a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. It's a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. I'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn't? '''

txt[25]='''I went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggest. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like something out of a live action Disney picture. The music, in particular the theme tune was uninspiring and added no impact or energy to the movie. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has. After waiting so long for a new Ghostbusters film this comes as a major disappointment. Some things are just best left alone. '''

txt[26]='''I was unfortunate enough to see an early screening with a friend and... man, this movie isn't bad; it's TERRIBLE. BEYOND TERRIBLE.

It's getting mixed to positive reviews, but the people liking this movie are the same people who jumped on-board the feminist "everyone who hates this film is a misogynist" train and they don't even mention anything beyond the parts they cherry-picked to like in the movie. Throughout the hour and a half + movie, the movie made a desperate attempt to be good to the point where it just appeared like they were trying too hard. Much of the humor is forced and most of the jokes are basic and can be seen/guessed even before the scene rolls. At times, it felt cheap and lazy. I thought I was watching a failing SNL parody rather than a good movie.

Leslie Jones is another problem; she portrays a stereotypical black woman with an attitude. Yelling? Check. Bitch slapping? Check. Every single stereotype about black woman? Check. Remember Winston Zeddemore from the original film? Was he a stereotypical black man at the time in the 1980s? Nope. Instead, he was an Average Joe who wanted a job and took it at Ghostbusters. Here, Leslie portrays her character in an almost-offensive manner when it comes to playing a stereotypical black woman. It's borderline inappropriate and, had she been a man, this film would've been TRASHED by critics for this portrayal of a character.

Also, it's Reverse Sexism in a film. Instead of treating both genders equally, Paul Feig displays men as idiots or assholes. This is true with Hemsworth's character, Kevin, who is the team's secretary. He's completely stupid, clueless and innocent; but mostly stupid. Janine in the original film was a smart, capable woman who had a lot of memorable moments and wasn't portrayed in a sexist, if not really unattractive manner. I almost walked out of the early screening because of how poorly men were portrayed in the film. And, probably, by now, everyone has heard of the atrocious final resolution to the final battle. SPOILER ALERT: SKIP IF YOU WANNA ACTUALLY SEE THIS BURNING DUMPSTER FIRE.

The final battle is resolved by shooting Rowan in the dick. That's right; four chicks shoot Rowan in the dick with their proton packs. -.- You probably already know this because of the GIF floating around the inter-webs, but, yeah. That's how the final battle ends; a really sexist approach to finishing the film. It sounds mild, but combine this with the portrayal of Kevin, Bill Murray's cameo and a few other male characters who interact with the main characters and you have a feminist film ready to go.

Along with these criticisms come with the really bad script that just acts like imitation crab in the food world; it's just an imitation. In fact, half the plot imitates the original in a distasteful manner that just really turns off Ghostbusters fans. It's unoriginal and it pays little homage to the films. When it does, it does it in lackluster fashion. Like, for example, Stay Puft's official sighting in this film is in parade balloon form, not true marshmallow form. If you were expecting at least one showdown with the destructive Puft himself, think again. He has been replaced by the logo ghost. XD

There's so much wrong with this movie, but these things are just a few of them. Thanks Paul Feig for messing Ghosbusters up. I guess Paul's been Busted and it felt good busting' this travesty of a film that will haunt GB fans for generations.

PROS: -Chris Hemsworth (For the most part) -Complete relief when the film ended

CONS: -Terrible acting -Abismal writing -Huge gaping plot holes (Like the inability to buy the firehouse but the ability to create advanced ghost busting technology and obtain parts and equipment.) -Poor CGI effects -Disrespectful cameos and treatment of original material -Reverse sexist message -A stereotypical caricature of a black woman (Leslie Jones as Patty) -Useless inclusion of Patty into the GB team -Non-existent character chemistry -Disappointing final battle which breaks all GB rules first established in the film -Unmemorable soundtrack -Poor editing -Inappropriate responses to constructive criticism hidden in film -Dull, ineffective, dry forced-humor -Identity crisis (Reboot or Sequel. Choose one, Feig.) -Laughable film effort in general

This film is BUSTED and busting this travesty of a film makes me feel good; better than good... GREAT.'''


txt[27]='''I've never seen the original Ghostbusters films, so I went into watching this with quite an open mind. It ended up being incredibly disappointing though, the CGI was terrible and reminded me of the early 2000s live action Scooby Doo films, the girls, who I'd imagine are funny in their own right, seemed to have absolutely zero chemistry between them and oddly enough Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin ended up being the most funny aspect of the film.

That's just my personal opinion however. My boyfriend who I went to see the film with whispered to me 'this is awful,' half way through and he revealed to me that he had felt ashamed while watching the film. I went because he guaranteed me it was going to be enjoyable and I think it didn't take long until he realised that the movie was a disappointment. '''

txt[28]='''Some people are saying that this is the wort movie of all time. It is not. It is merely a really bad movie with no redeeming qualities, and it insults your intelligence.

And, most of the YouTube videos made slamming it are 100s of times funnier than this movie.

Seriously, the movie is just not funny. In fact Batman and Robin (George Clooney and whoever played Robin) had more humor in it than this movie does, and that movie was worse than this one--that is how not funny this movie is.
'''

txt[29]='''As fan of the original movies it's sad to see the extreme change of direction here. The humor in the original movies were heartfelt and funny, the effects were charming, and I think it even works today, in its way. The effects in this one is more expensive, has more details, but is much more comical, in a bad way. The comedy is about yelling, exaggerated hip hop slang, and fast-paced, waaaay too easy jokes.

In the original movies, Ivan Reitman was the real nerd-scientist who outsmarted anyone in any room; Dan Aykroyd was the doomsday historian who really had some fun lines in his movie-fact-based monologues about evil; Bill Murray was a jerk, but he had a journey about improving himself, that made him likable; And Ernie Hudson started out as this "I don't care about anything as long as I get paid"-guy. This diverse group found something together that created a friendship based on real-felt trust, and they became a good team to hunt ghosts and save people. There was a real journey there. I don't feel the journey on this new one, I really don't.

Because... I want the old comedy, not this lightheaded piece of "refurbished material" (to use a non-angry term). The original movies were about Individuals having believable comedic and heartfelt separate journeys, while I feel this movie is all about characters playing stupid, fast-paced jokes on each other. All the time.. When there are some hints of emotions in this movie I don't believe in it..

So much that I give it a 1. Normally the 1 is reserved, by me, for zero-budget independent movies with actors with incoherent dialogue delivering, and a photo that lacks the technical craft-ship to give us a believable understanding of the surroundings. This one is made by real Hollywood people, but you know what they say:

You can't polish a "refurbished material"!

First, Leslie Jones (while sometimes funny on SNL) should hang up her acting career and stick to stand-up. She was horrible! I thought I was watching a female Richard Pryor on steroids. Kate McKinnon must have gone to the same acting class as Leslie. The only female deserving of being on the movie at all was Melisa McCarthy because she at least can hold up the others in the cast.

They should have cut the remainder of the movie 15 minutes in and replaced it with old Godzilla footage. Maybe have Melissa McCarthy stomping on toy trucks and cars. '''

The new film, is an emotionless void. We had been sold by the build up, directors telling us they wanted to commit to film the best extreme extreme sports action sequences possible. They failed. We heard how they were committed to using real athletes to make the scenes as authentic as possible. They needn't have bothered when they are using so much CGI anyway. Take the wingsuit scene for example. The crack is one of the best known lines in the sport, and a quick 5 minute search on YouTube will fine you dozens of clips of many different people flying that exact same line with better cinematography, filmed by their mate with a GoPro on his helmet. The film instead cuts in CGI close ups which absolutely diminish the incredible skill of the pilots who flew the line for the film. Aside from that, the plot is weak, the acting is wooden and you don't care about the characters at all, but that's not why we went. We were sold on the promise of the best extreme sports scenes ever filmed, and what we got was a complete mess, full of the CGI we were hoping to be absent. '''

txt[41]='''Sequels are watched based upon the strength of their predecessors. It is known that most sequels aren't as good but sometimes the first installment was so good that the sequel can never live up to it and nor does it have to to be appreciated. The Ring was the scariest movie I'd seen in 20 years. I remember being genuinely spooked when watching that movie. Part two wasn't as good but it was watchable. Rings, on the other hand, was trash.

We all know the premise by now: watch the video, get a phone call and then you have seven days to live. We all know who Samara is and we all know what she does to her victims, so that avenue is cutoff as far as generating scares. Where do you go from there then if you want to try to cash in on the Samara craze one more time?

In Rings a professor discovers the Samara video and watches it. He also finds out that in order to stop the impending death all he has to do is record it and have someone else watch it. He then decides to turn this into an experiment in order to answer some elusive metaphysical questions. He ensures that all of his subjects are able to shake the Samara curse by recording the video and having another person watch it. Of course this would be a never ending chain of video watching but whatever. In steps the main characters, two lovebirds that are prime scary movie age (18-25).

The writers completely mailed this one in. There was no real thought given to how they would revive the Samara story. There was no legitimate path for the main character, Julia (Matilda Lutz), to be inserted into this movie yet the writers clumsily shoe horned her in there; which meant I had to be assaulted by her poor acting the entire movie. In fact, I'd say that was the scariest thing: her acting.

With no fresh and innovative means to scare its audience the director relied on cheap jump scares: suddenly opening umbrella, barking dog, truck horn, breaking glass, etc. Not one of these lousy attempts at spooking the viewer even managed to register a single uptick in heart rate. This movie was lame from the word "go".

They did attempt to legitimize the movie by casting actors such as The Big Bang Theory's Johnny Galecki and veteran actor Vincent D'Onofrio but their talents were wasted. This movie was an abysmal failure and even though Samara may not be dead and gone this franchise certainly is.

God, there's so much lacking compared to the original that I could just ramble out a whole bullet point list, but I'll try to name a few so that it just doesn't look like I'm bitching for no reason. The way the "TV People" interact with Carole Ann (now Maddy for some reason) and their family to gain their trust? Mostly gone. The crazy insane manifestations in the house? Also mostly gone. The way the original made you feel bad for the spirits? Again, mostly gone. And Burke is a *terrible* replacement for Tangina for a variety of reasons. Really, the only good scene is when they fly the drone into the Other Side. That's it. They don't even introduce the creepy-as- hell theme song. If you want to watch a Poltergeist movie, stick to the original 1982 version and not this garbage. Poltergeist II is a pretty good scare as well. Hell, I might even pick Poltergeist III over this remake ha ha... '''

txt[43]='''Not much to say, after watching the "Rings". If you have seen the first two movies, then you should just skip this one. It's a disgrace for the series. Repiod.

Awful story, terrible acting, not even a single scary scene. Even when Samara appears, you are not scared, but sad... Not because of her story, but because of the series falloff...

Personally, I loved the first movie and enjoyed the second, even though I found it mediocre. This one, however, is one of the least interesting movies I have seen in my whole life.

Shame, shame, shame... '''

txt[44]='''Me and my girlfriend went to see this together, expecting it to be bad. We are both big horror movie fans. I loved Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, and I seriously enjoyed the new Ouija movie also. (so did my girlfriend) anyway we went to the theater expecting a "meh" and mostly bad movie, but this was just HORRIBLE. The acting was beyond cringe, and we had more fun laughing and making fun of the movie then we did actually watching the movie. Nothing made sense and it felt like they were making it up as they went. It was not even slightly scary, long and boring, bad acting, horrible plot, and pointless things happening that had no connection. It also basically just re told the first story as well. I do not recommend wasting your money on this horrible movie. '''

txt[45]='''OK so I knew going in based off what I read from reviews (not that I will ever trust the user reviews like I used too) but I just knew from the trailer and cast that this wasn't going to be good. But that is putting very mildly. This was just one horrible movie. I did enjoy the first one with Naomi Watts, but I swear this film was a mega piece of s...t. From the very beginning to the very end, this was a nonstop crap fest. Watch if you want, or better yet....don't...lol This movie goes on the unfolding of origin of why the girl with the long black who comes out of the well in seven days. It's tells us the reason why, but uses the wrong characters to do so. I will rarely say I hate something, but I so hated this film. It was a waste of my time. AVOID AT ALL COST. AND YES ITS THAT BAD!

txt[46]='''I sincerely hope the original Point Break is much different than this lifeless, hippy-dippy, overblown Mountain Dew commercial. I've never seen the original movie, so I have no bias towards it. Based on the movie's own merit's, the Point Break remake is laughably awful. In Point Break, a rookie FBI agent tracks down a group of extreme athletes who go around the world carrying out crimes in unusual and life-threatening ways; they plan to do a series of near- impossible stunts called the Ozaki 8 in hopes of reaching spiritual enlightenment. At least, that was the plot for about ten minutes before the movie devolves into a series of party scenes and surprisingly dull extreme sports clips that could have been easily viewed on YouTube, all set to irritating club music. It takes a special director to make BASE jumping and cliff diving this boring. Ericson Core builds as little suspense as possible in his action set pieces and instead films admittedly well-shot highlights reels for the action scenes. Any sort of suspense conjured up is because of the great cinematography because the characters are so flat and annoying that you almost wish they would get killed off. Everyone in this movie acts stoned out of their mind. All they do is spit faux- philosophical nonsense which gets tiring after the first twenty minutes. It gets laughable towards the end of the movie with lines like "Ideas are strong. But not as strong as a whaling ship," and no amount of context will make that line any less ridiculous. The unbearable dialog, muddled plot and dull characters makes this Point Break remake utterly pointless. If you're not a fan of remakes, this will make you reach your breaking point. '''

txt[47]='''I was enthusiastically exuberant about returning to what I've known as a cult classic, the original "Point Break". This reboot, is full of slick stunts and visuals, but the story, or lack thereof, makes this taste like pablum. I very seriously doubt that after two hours from getting out of the theater watching this, that anybody would even remember the name's of the central characters in this film. Why, because the film maker neglected to give us a story where the characters are expounded and fleshed out beyond the 3 minutes for any resolute back-story on any of them. I appreciate the stunts and stunt people for their quality work involved, but stunts don't make a movie. A good story, with quality characters that are inter-meshed with emotions and plots that pull the viewer into the characters' world is what makes a memorable film. I'll stick with the original "Point Break". '''

txt[48]='''This movie really is unbelievably terrible. It's basically a bunch of extreme sport stunt shots glued together with nonsensical storyline, bad acting and awful script.

It's one of those movies that's so bad they can't even keep basic details straight, such as they drive off a boat at night time for a swim, but it's clearly daytime once they get underwater.

There are some scenes that have literally no bearing on the story at all...such as the scene at the pier when the FBI UK guy is randomly pulling a boat out of the water.

The time-line of just about every event makes no sense at all.

The characters have nothing at all about them; they all seems to merge into one hipster bearded blob on the screen and the only way i managed to tell them apart was from their color coded outfits. '''

txt[49]='''This is my first review ever although I have been a member of IMDb for years,the reason for my review is to warn people how ridiculously bad this movie is!!!! Luckily I saw it on TV and switched of halfway through the movie,so don't expect an in-depth review but rather a warning.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CRAP!!!!

I'm a big fan of the original,it was made in the 90's and by today's standards it maybe a little over the top,but at least there were some sort of character building and a bond between them.According to this new movie an FBI agent jumps of a cliff and calls someone "Bro" and suddenly has an internal bond with a criminal,who by the way just killed a few innocent people 5 min ago!?!?!?

Ray Winstone is a brilliant actor but not even he can save this senseless "Red Bull" advert and makes one wonder is work really that hard to find for someone of his caliber?? How this got a Rating of 5.5 in IMDb doesn't say much for the rating system as I have seen much better movies on here rated 2.5 either that or most of the reviewers of this movie is 12yr old school boys who like tattoos???

txt[51]=''' rarely write movie reviews, but this movie was just so bad that I felt compelled to share my opinion. The acting is horrible, the story is horrible and the dialogue is horrible. The studio basically wanted to appeal to the x-games audience so threw scenes from every extreme sport they could think of. The movie includes snowboarding, sky diving, rock climbing, motocross and surfing. The story is about a group of guys that steal from rich corporations and give it to the poor and want to complete 8 extreme challenges. The story really did not make a lot of sense and the dialogue is extremely clich√©d and poorly written. I really felt like I had wasted 90 minutes of my life after watching this movie. '''
