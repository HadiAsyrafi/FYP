txt[0]='''Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.

If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an "epic," and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).

A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.

The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.

Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.'''

txt[1]='''Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome. '''

txt[2]='''Although the film is perhaps a little slow in fully developing, the consequent results are astounding. Spacey's performance is captivating and will only be fully appreciated once the viewing is complete. The supporting cast, including Gabriel Byrne, provide the basis for a convincing drama which will change the way you perceive crime thrillers in the future.

One is required to discover the identity of the elusive Keyser Soze throughout the film and if it were not for the well thought-out script and professional dramatic acting then the viewer would feel a sense of anti-climax. However, this is not the case; you shall be left speechless and wondering how the film achieved its goal. '''

txt[3]='''I have seen this movie many times and yet it still astonishes me every time I watch it. Even though I know the ending I still feel myself being caught up in the plot. It is possibly one of the greatest scripts of all time. I can't remember another movie in which I was completely astonished at the finale. The cast gives a tremendous performance. Kevin Spacey gives one of his two best performances (the other being as John Doe in Se7en) in my opinion. That is probably why he was awarded Best Actor for this role. It was truly deserved. Gabriel Byrne also gives a great performance. It may be the best character Stephen Baldwin has ever played. In all, this is a must for any movie collector or enthusiast. '''

txt[4]='''The film "the usual suspects" is brilliant by means of many different facets of film making; and brought together perfectly to comprise one of the most historic and critically acclaimed films of all time. To start, the plot alone is intelligent and baffling, so much that the general public is challenged to piece together a seemingly surrealistic account of mystery and murder. However, there's more to this movie than just the mere genius behind the plot. For starters, the cinematography, editing, and acting are captured perfectly to not only portray a story, but involve the audience as though they were to experience the story themselves. Additionally, the actors are brilliant and capture each character as precise as necessary to accurately forshadow the climactic point of the movie that leaves audiences breathless.

However, behind the brilliance of the film, the editing, the acting, the storyline, the script, and the cinematography; are the ingenious facts hidden within the movie's composition. The antagonist himself was based off of a real-life serial murderer, whose actions are depicted in the film under alternative pretenses.

In all, this movie portrays the perfection of cinematography and should be the precedent that movie-makers strive to achieve. '''

txt[5]='''Warning: Spoilers ahead

Nicely filmed, with good atmosphere, but a pretty lame plot. I had the surprise plot twist at the end figured out in the first half-hour: standard thing about mysteries is that at least one person is always lying. When you only have one person telling a story, it's pretty easy to figure out whom that would be.

But an enjoyable film to watch in any case. Worth renting, not worth buying. Definitely not worth its place in the top 250 films. '''

txt[6]='''The 1995 movie, Usual Suspects is a suspense thriller that will keep you guessing right up until the very end. This movie starts out with a robbery and a murder in the dead of night on a cargo ship. Special agent Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) is investigating the hijacking of a truck full of guns. The movie follows the interrogations of a group of well known thugs; McManus (Stephen Bladwin), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fenster (Benicio Del Torro), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal (Kevin Spacey).

The Usual Suspects is suspenseful movies that could be a modern day Hitchcock thriller. Nothing is as it seems as Verbal (Kevin Spacey) tells his accounts of the previous days before the robbery on the cargo ship to special agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Verbal, a week and meager man that seems out of place in the company of the other vicious group of thugs accused of the truck and gun heist gives a detailed story of the time leading up to robbery. Keyser Soze, a mythical character in the movie is a violent, fearless, heartless man that is feared by many even though no one can say what Keyser Soze actually looks like. He is the boogie man that is pulling the strings behind the scenesâ€¦or is he?

This movie uses lighting and shadows to physically pull you into the suspense of each plot twist and turn. The shadows make the movie more suspenseful because it shows you just enough to make you think you know what's going on but enough darkness to make you wonder. It will have you changing your mind every second wondering who is behind the mask of darkness hiding in the shadows. '''

txt[7]='''Thanks mainly to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), the 1990's saw the re-emergence of crime noir - talky, violent thrillers packed with colourful characters and even more colourful language. Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects was one of the best of the bunch, thanks mainly to the director taking influence from past masters such as Hitchcock, Lang and Kurosawa, rather than the many Tarantino copycats that flooded the 90's cinema market, who did little but poorly imitate the big-chinned one's chatty screenplays and outlandish, darkly humorous violence. It also had a killer twist; one that will baffle as much as it will surprise, or possibly induce cries of cheap manipulation.

After what appears to be a heist gone wrong on an exploded boat, the only surviving witness, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a disabled con-man, is brought in to be interrogated by customer officer Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Having already been acquitted by some mysterious higher powers, Kint is probed by Kujan for more information. He tells a story of five criminals who meets in a line-up - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a steely criminal gone straight, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), an entry man with a short fuse, Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker, Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus's partner, and Kint himself. Having being picked up one time too many, the group hatch a plot to pay the crooked cops back, and eventually start taking jobs from the shady Redfoot (Peter Greene).

While the build-up to the explosion seen at the beginning of the film is relatively formulaic in its execution, Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for his efforts) inject enough humour into the script to bring these characters alive, and bring them over to your side. The clever thing is that it soon becomes apparent that everything were seeing either isn't true or isn't at all relevant, and it's the increasingly looming presence of the mysterious and infamous criminal mastermind Keyser Soze, who may in fact hold all the cards. The twist is not particularly clever at all, and isn't that hard to guess, but the director's skill in capturing it is what makes it so memorable.

The now-iconic poster wouldn't be so iconic if the characters hadn't been so memorably played by it's cast. With the exception of Kint, the characters are little but stock characters, but there is genuine chemistry, especially in the line-up scene where they crack up after Baldwin's over-the-top delivery of a line. Byrne proves again that he is much more deserving than the mediocre roles he tends to land, and Spacey bagged a Supporting Actor Oscar for his puppy-dog con-man. It's far, far from deserving of its place as #23 on IMDb's top films of all time, but The Usual Suspects is riveting stuff, even after it's umpteenth viewing.'''

txt[8]='''This is a great movie, lots of twists and turns. Kept you guessing till the end. I saw this movie years after it came out and was surprised that the ending was never leaked out I was very surprised to find out at the end of the movie Verbal's true identity. A lot of well known actors were in this movie. Kevin Spacey did a wonderful performance. Kevin Pollack had a few one liners that were funny- his stand up act is very good. I thought it was hilarious when Pollack called Spacey peg leg. I really enjoyed the interaction between Stephen and Benico. They have good chemistry with one another. Chazz did a great job as the detective. '''

txt[9]='''...the Usual Suspects is that film. Many like myself were floored by the final plot twist and it's since become a classic.

Our story begins at the end, when the unseen criminal mastermind Keyser Soze, shoots an acquaintance of his on a boat. Soze escapes after he lights the fuse that will blow up the boat. The police arrive and the investigation kicks off. This leads to Agent Kujan talking with/interrogating one of the suspects, a cripple called Verbal Kint. They casually chat in an office and slowly Verbal begins telling him the events that lead to that fateful night at the docks.

Doesn't sound like much at first glance, but the final twist will have you reexamining everything that came before. It changes everything. Some might criticize the fact that the nature of the twist undoes a lot of what came before, but when the twist is this good, who even cares? In fact, it slightly reminds me of Kurosawa's RashÃ´mon with its different retellings of the same events. It also helps that the twist is so wonderfully presented by editor/composer John Ottman. What's particularly pleasing about the twist is that you find all kinds of hints with repeat viewings. A small line here, a little visual clue there, little things that'll make you wonder how you didn't notice these things before.

The acting is also noteworthy, particularly Spacey's. Once you figure out his game, watching his performance becomes very entertaining. Very multi-layered. The rest of the 'usual suspects' are all great as well. The ones that deserve special mention are Benicio del Toro who injects a basically useless character with a lot of life and wit and Pete Postlethwaith, who plays Soze's assistant with a dryness that is both terrifying and fun to watch.

The Usual Suspects is, in a way, my kind of mystery/thriller/crime/drama film. Everything builds up to a wonderful twist that has you rethinking the rest of the story. It adds a lot of replay value, not to mention the added bonus of trying to find all the hints strewn across the story like breadcrumbs. '''

txt[10]='''No matter how many times I watch The Usual Suspects, and believe me it's been many, I still get the same diabolical thrill, the same rapturous excitement and the same rush of storytelling and dramatic payoff as I did the very first time I saw it. Every performance from the vast and diverse cast is a devilish creation packed with red herrings, juicy dialogue and bushels of menace, every scene piles on the mysticism of the criminal underworld beat by beat, until the characters begin to pick it apart and the whole thing unravels like a great serpent coiling forth bit by bit, scale by scale, swerving toward the shocking, disarming third act that has since become as legendary as it's elusive and terrifying antagonist. In the crime/mystery corner of cinema, there's no arguing that this delicious piece of hard boiled intrigue reigns supreme, and it's easy to see why. In a seemingly random police lineup, five career criminals are harassed by an unseen hand, pushed into carrying out dangerous heists and violent manoeuvres by a shadowy campfire tale among the world of organized crime, a Boogeyman called Keyser Soze, if he even exists at all. Slick and sleazy ex cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) heads up this dysfunctional crew of vagabonds which includes hothead McManus (Stephen Baldwin in a role originally intended for Michael Biehn, which kills me to this day), weirdo Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, using an indecipherable mishmash of an accent that would be the first of many), spitfire Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) the runt of the litter. The lot of them are intimidated into performing risky enterprises by lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) until the climate of their actions reaches a boiling point and answers emerge from the darkness. This is all told in retrospect by Spacey, to a rabid customs agent (Chazz Palminteri) who has designs on ensnaring Soze. Spacey scored Oscar gold for his heavy work here, spinning a tale whose layers interweave and pull the wool over our eyes time and time again before offering any glimpses of truth. Byrne is a fiercely guarded storm as Keaton, a man with secrets so deep even he doesn't know who he is anymore, letting the anger set and smoulder in those glacial eyes of his. The supporting cast adds to the class and confusion terrifically, with fine work pouring in from Dan Hedeya, Suzy Amis, Giancarlo Esposito and a wicked cameo from Peter Greene, who provides a moment of inspired improv. The score of the film rarely relies on dips and swells until all is said and done, keeping a tight lid on the orchestra and feeding us nervous little riffs of anxious portent that keeps tension on a tightrope and anticipation on call. A mystery this tantalizing is irresistible the first time around, but the trick is to make your story re-watchable, and I've seen this thing over a dozen times. Every viewing provides some new angle to the story I didn't see before, or I notice a subtle interaction in the very naturalistic and funny dialogue which escaped me in the past. My favourite thing to do is watch films with someone who hasn't seen them before, observe their reactions and opinions on every little story beat and cinematic flourish, it's almost more fun for me than the actual film itself. The Usual Suspects is a showcase piece for that activity, because you get to see this very complex revelation unfold through new eyes as you watch them experience the revelations. Whether your first viewing or your fiftieth, it never loses its power, and the spell it casts just doesn't dim. Masterpiece '''

txt[11]='''The Usual Suspects is one of the best movies ever made, but you won't know that until the final credits roll. While there are many good films that possess the potential to be great but whose ending diminishes their story and film quality (Chinatown, for example, in this genre), the Usual Suspects is one of those rare ones whose quality and film score actually both elevate due to its ending. All in all, you have a fresh, original, and incredibly unique film that still twenty years later separates itself from all others in its genre.

Everybody likes a mystery, and The Usual Suspects easily has one of the best endings of any movie ever. The first time I watched it, I thought it was pretty good but nothing too special, but the ending was so fresh and original that it immediately became one of my favorite movies ever. Rewatching it, you appreciate the story and acting even more, and the ending never fails or disappoints due to the amazing editing and meticulous unveiling of the mystery. For me, this is an easy 10/10 because it's a well made movie that is totally different, original, and nothing was truly made quite like it before it or since. '''

txt[12]='''Sometimes the sum is greater than the parts. The parts are good, but when it all comes together, and fits, just right, there's something more. The Usual Suspects might be the perfect example of this. Nothing on its own stands out. But together, all the pieces fit.

Told in flashback by Kevin Spacey, the audience follows the events leading up to a shoot-out and massacre on a boat. Following a group of 5 criminals (alternating lead between Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne) from job to job, the plot is told straightforward but lays down layers of dense intricacy and relationships. The story becomes increasingly revolved around the mysterious legend, Keyser Soze.

At its heart The Usual Suspects is merely a mystery told incredibly well. No scene is wasted- the film is tightly paced at just over an hour and a half- and the characterisation comes through immediately. Kevin Spacey's purposefully monotone voice-over is often merely exposition, but the framing device and the dialogue make it work without ever seeming dull.

One should take a moment to bring up the dialogue, which is actually a lot better than many give it credit for. While the screenplay is better known for how it comes together at the end, the whole script is full of wit and slick lines. McQuarrie is well deserving of his Oscar.

Yet one cannot really do a review of The Usual Suspects without reference to the ending. It's a film that relies on its ending to enhance the rest of it. Previous scenes have more meaning, and its cleverness becomes apparent. The main criticism one can see is if the ending is spoiled (which given its infamy is increasingly likely), it can neuter the impact.

Aside from that, The Usual Suspects does no wrong. A giant puzzle with satisfying parts, which when complete reveals a jigsaw masterpiece. '''

txt[13]='''Brian Singer's thriller tells a slick, ridiculous but hugely entertaining yarn, with a postmodern twist: much of its shock value deriving from confounding the expectations of the audience rather than from the innate properties of the story. Kevin Spacey is excellent as Verbal Kint, the man with a tale to tell the police; and the film as a whole is sharp and concise, leaving the viewer with an appetite for more.

But in spite of this, the film is good, rather than great. There are holes in the plot, and the essential device is actually a breach of the universal contract between the movie-goer and the the film-maker: the only way to avoid being suckered would be to adopt a scepticism so thorough-going that it would be impossible to enjoy this (or indeed any other) fictional tale. Neither of these things really matter, but what is more of a problem is the nugatory quality of what results: instead of delighting us with alternative realities, the film destroys its own premise without putting anything concrete in its place, as if it has no purpose beyond teasing. Teasing, however, is something it does extraordinarily well. In conclusion, 'The Usual Suspects' is a superior work of contemporary entertainment; but too empty to be rated a masterpiece.'''

txt[14]='''The title comes from a line in the classic film "Casablanca" (1942), where the corrupt police chief, anxious to cover up the murder of a Nazi officer, tells a subordinate to "round up the usual suspects," meaning that the police should find a bunch of random criminals to be questioned. In the film, the usual suspects are five small-time crooks who are brought together in a police line-up on trumped-up charges. Funny thing - the idea for this movie started only with the concept of a movie poster of five of guys in a lineup.

"The Usual suspects " is a modestly-budgeted piece . All the actors worked for less than their usual fees. It shows you their dedication to the project and seems impossible to make this film today , when almost every movie has a 200 mln budget. This movie doesn't have budget , but it has the thing that is really the most important in a movie â€“ screenplay.

The ending is one of the most memorable scenes in movie history . It's very simple and very effective . Simply unforgettable , when the truth hits you like a ton of bricks. The quote from the French poet Charles Baudelaire "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist" appears in this movie and it's definitely one of the most famous lines in movie history.

The story seems convoluted , but in the end makes perfect sense. It grabs you from the start with the mystery of what happened in the docks. There are more mysteries and twists along the way until the very end. Like every good criminal this movie does lose it's magic on repeated viewings , yet not quite. On repeated viewings you can see many clues you might have missed . You will also notice how well written the dialogues are.

Kevin Spacey gives quite possibly the best performance of his career as fast-talking yet shy con artist crippled by cerebral palsy. He deserved Oscar . The rest of the cast shines too - Gabriel Byrne , Benicio Del Toro , Kevin Pollak , Chazz Palmintieri and even Stephen Baldwin. The music by John Ottman is underrated . It's very elegant and moody score. Bryan Singer directs with confidence and energy , never allowing the plot to be confusing.

The only bad thing I can say about this movie that it's only a game . There's nothing , no message , no substance underneath this brilliant construction. It's just a pure entertainment and intelligent fun with the viewer , but who said that's a bad thing ? I give it 9/10. '''

I was feeling somewhat disappointed at how obvious the initial twist was however when the final twist occurred, revealing Costner as the villain, it made me totally reassess the movie into being one of my all time favourites.

There were so many classic scenes in the movie that it would be impossible for it not to be in anybody top 25. The way the officer realised what Soze had done to him was classic. As an audience, we relived the movie in a few shots as we pieced together Soze's fake story and it all came together so brilliantly. Fantastic '''

txt[16]='''Say what you will about this low-budget Oscar winning hit-but if you were lucky enough to catch it initially on the big-screen then you know what I mean. It opens up with the tail end of a massacre on boat just before being lit up to flames. We then end up in interrogation room with Verbal Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) telling the cops how he ended up on the boat. At this point the movie seems to pick up the events (mostly) in the order they happened until those crucial moments on the horrific ship. As Verbal goes into detail how him and four other ex-cons were wrongfully detained for questioning 6 weeks earlier and ended up working together 'taking jobs.' There's Keeton (Gabriel Byrne) who is looking for way out and go straight, Finster (Benicio Del Toro who really started his career here literally) whose horrible accent brings a lot of laughs but basically pals around his convict hot headed buddy McMannis(Stephen Baldwin). Then there's Hockney(Kevin Pollock)whose comedic input serves the tone well especially since he really plays the angry smart ass of the gang. I really don't want to type too much else cause either A most of you know the story even if you haven't seen it or B you've seen it. What I really wanted to say about this movie is that people who don't like it are people who never really got it or people who have not seen the whole thing from the beginning. Yes I said I love this movie and I'll always defend it. However, the movie holds up the best way in an initial viewing or maybe 4 or 5 times after that. '''

Simply put, films don't get much more original than this. It is entertaining without losing any artistic or visceral edge, a direct result of McQuarrie's genius screenplay.

txt[21]='''Movies, as other art forms, can manipulate us in ways that we would not be manipulated in real life. Such is the intent of 'The Usual Suspects', and it is a real disappointment in the final analysis. Basically, the last few minutes of the movie are saying to us: "we tried to dupe you into believing all of this is true, but now you have to go back, watch the whole thing again, and differentiate between realty and a fantasy story as told by a twisted, compulsive-lying, self-perceived genius".

But when you watch the whole thing again, you (at least if you are remotely analytical) realize that the vast majority of the movie up to the last few minutes is the fantasy story as told by the twisted self-perceived genius, and only a small portion is realty. So you come to understand that only the small portion that is reality can be believed and that the entire rest of the movie that is the recollection of the twisted self-perceived genius is most likely a big LIE. But then so many people love this movie that I suppose the vast majority of us enjoy getting duped.

But ask yourself this: what would you think if, at the end of The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne woke up next to his wife and said to her "Honey, you won't believe the dream I just had. It was a dream, wasn't it?" And she just lay there motionless not saying anything. And you wonder - was it real or was it Memorex?

It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times. In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something. I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.

So, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had a mismatched ad campaign. The ads made it seem like the movie was about street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a man's psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer society. As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who would recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters. This is one of the most underrated movies I know.

I always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and this movie scores a 10 in both. Those who enjoyed The Game, Memento, or The Matrix really should check it out. '''

txt[23]='''Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand. Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men ("No great war to fight, no great depression"), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days. '''

txt[24]='''Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow values, rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick and ironically consumer oriented fashion. In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life. The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends. The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value. My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again.

This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.

This movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.'''

txt[26]='''After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar. '''

txt[27]='''Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.

There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999. '''

txt[28]='''Roger Ebert says the second half of this movie turns into the most unremitting violence ever shown on film. He says the movie makes the mistake of masquerading as philosophical, and the point of the movie was probably taken the wrong way by many viewers. Roger Ebert is my favorite movie reviewer of all time, but he is dead wrong. Whatever you take away from Fight Club is whatever you take away. It is what is. This is the smartest movie I have ever watched and the best movie of 1999. You should definitely see this movie. Talk about it with your parents, smart friends, dumb friends. Different people see the point of this movie in different ways. At the end of the day, Fight Club does one simple thing. It empowers people to live more productive lives. Do something new, be a part of life. Or don't. Be the most productive person you can be in whatever you want to be productive in. Fight Club- 10/10 '''

txt[29]='''This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it. Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times. His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.

This is a pretty low-key movie with the other star, Bruce Willis, playing an extremely subdued role for him, almost too subdued. There are times in here when you keep waiting for him to say something, and he says nothing. Half the time he's barely audible.

But he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen. To explain the story would almost ruin it, because it's preposterous. I'll just call an interesting fantasy-horror film with a little family story tied in with Willis' wife (Robin Wright) and young boy (Spencer Treat Clark).

"Unbreakable" is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end....one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. This movie is done by the same man who did "The Sixth Sense," M. Night Shyamalan, so if you enjoyed that you probably would like this, too.....although it's so different I wouldn't want to predict who would like this film and who wouldn't. If you're open to try something different, give it a look. '''

txt[30]='''My kudos to M. Night Shyamalan for proving the consistency of his moviemaking abilities. "Unbreakable" is a movie that is rich in both technical brilliance as well as script quality.

First, let me get my one objection for the movie off my chest. The ending could have been done better. The majority of the length of "Unbreakable" does an excellent job of building suspense, with the wonderfully muted, melancholy acting adding depth and tension to the plot. My problem is that it fails to live up to its own expectations; the ending does not consummate entirely what I expected it to. Somehow, in a movie that took painstaking details to illustrate every step and glance, concluding it in the manner that it did felt almost blasphemous. Maybe in a nameless action thriller it could be passed off as mere hackery. But here, it seems strangely out of place, kind of an enigma in itself...

Now that the ugly part is over with, I feel almost obligated to sing the praises of "Unbreakable". Shyamalan's prowess with photographic techniques and processes shows through in this, with rich reds and blacks given to scenes of moist emotion and colder colors dedicated to the bleak, uncaring (uncared for?) world. One technique I particularly liked was the manipulation of photographic mediums, some parts using crisp 35mm films and others using angry, shuttered magnetic (or 16mm?) film. In the end, it all worked very well, because each technique seemed to integrate seamlessly with the plot and mood (notice the confusion and panic at the very end?) "Traffic" is a good example of processing overdose. "Unbreakable", on the other hand, hones it perfectly. The lushness of this movie comes in close second to the wonderful eye candy of "American Beauty". I could watch it again easily... with the sound turned off!

On the more human side of the spectrum, the acting was wonderful. How nice it is to see Bruce Willis proving himself to be a true A-class actor! His unassuming and insecure behavior worked *perfectly* for this role. Samuel L. Jackson, like always, did a bang-up job with what the script gave him. Robin Wright and Spencer Clark's characters seemed a bit two dimensional, but they seemed to be minor roles compared to the prominence of Willis and Jackson's characters. A little character development would have been appreciated, but if the ending was a result of the time-constraint guillotine, then I would expect the developmental scenes to have gone too.

The thing that people seem to complain most about this movie is the plot. I like the premise. A little fantasy in our movies isn't such a bad thing once in a while, is it? '''

txt[31]='''I love this film. I'm the only person I know who doesn't hate it, but I cannot fathom why it gets such a bad rap from everybody. It seems that Shyamalan's films have this a running theme - with the notable exception of the Sixth Sense, which pretty much everyone seems to get. He makes movies that are very subtle, and which seem to need you to focus on them just right to fully grasp what he was trying to do. I've enjoyed all his movies, but for me the alien part of Signs takes a lot away from what I believe to be the central storyline and as such the whole movie suffers a little. Yet I know other people who think Signs is his best, specifically because of the way the alien plot line accentuates the central one.

Unbreakable is a beautifully simple film, but I think it has to hit you just right for you to completely get it. All the actors nail their parts, particularly Bruce Willis and his kid. Shyamalan takes an interesting (if slightly fringe) theory and puts it in a real world context, with a real family. Somehow he manages to never go overboard with it and - for me at least - it gripped me from the first moment to the last. Samuel L Jackson's character history is really nicely crafted in the middle of the other plot lines and you get genuinely involved in the people Shyamalan has created.

Don't get caught up in all the talk of the twist ending. The ending is good, but if you spend the whole movie waiting for this tumultuous twist you'll inevitably be disappointed, and the movie stands alone without it.

Don't go into this movie expecting another Sixth Sense or Signs. It's very very subtle and very understated. If you don't like slow movies, just don't watch this because it moves at a very sedate pace, but I personally think you'll be missing out. You'll likely either love it or you'll loathe it, but at least it will make an impression. '''

txt[32]='''An hour and a half into this movie I wondered how Shyamalan would wrap the film up in a nice little package, without room for a sequel. I shouldn't of bothered. The film was superb and the ending was a bigger twist than The Sixth Sense. Anybody who doesn't get Unbreakable should stick to Disney films. Bruce Willis proves once again that he can act. Most of the plaudits for Sixth Sense went to the kid and Twelve Monkeys to Pitt, although Jackson is superb as usual, Bruce Willis steals the movie with a subtleness most screen stars cannot portray. Unbreakable is a great way to start off what should be a fine year for movies. '''

txt[33]='''I watched Unbreakable again the other day, for about the 20th time and it's still my favourite film of all time. I am by no means a casual viewer and have seen thousands of films in my life but this movie just speaks to me. In part I guess that this has to be because the protagonist, David Dunn has a life that mirrors my own in many ways (without the superpowers of course) but also because it reveals the human condition and our potential to all be heroic. Also having grown up reading comics this film addressed how comics have shaped popular culture in the 20th century and became modern myth. A couple of years ago I spoke to the owner of a Comics store here in South Australia who said he didn't like the film because (spoiler ahead) the villain created the hero. I found that opinion bizarre since this has always been the case in comics and fiction in general, for without evil to fight there is no need of a hero. I enjoyed Shymalan's first three films immensely and it is a shame that this film was in many ways considered a disappointment both critically and financially after the success of The Sixth Sense. Anyway if you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it. Superb acting with Bruce Willis in top form, a fantastic score by James Newton Howard and excellent cinematography. Check it out. '''

This is sort of a family movie, you may not feel like wanting to see it, but once you see it, you are glad that you did. A major part of the story is the subtle but deep love you have for your wife and child, which you can't quite see and sometimes forget in the hustle and bustle of life.

Highly recommended if you like stories that are insightful. This movie was never meant to impress us, sort of the opposite, so that the subtle things won't be lost when we see it.

txt[35]='''A powerful movie that I waited too long to watch. I have not been a big fan of M. Night before. I like "The Sixth Sense" and "Signs", but this one is close to being my favorite. I can't decide on that right now, I would have to watch it a few more times and let it sink in.

Jackson and Willis are both great. Willis is especially good when plays toned down characters who aren't too over the top. Here is gives a very somber performance. I felt bad for Jackson's character and I thought the dialogue was written well. The analyzing of what a superhero is and what someone like that could be in real life is excellent. I wish the story went on a little further. It feels like it ends right when you don't want it to.'''

txt[36]=''' I rate this movie a solid 10, and I feel that whenever you rate any movie a 10, it deserves a very good explanation. I don't rate movies based on what I think of other movies in that genre. Nor do I compare movies to other movies made by the same director. So, while I could compare this to The Sixth Sense, and say that I like The Sixth Sense better... How is that a good reason for a lower rating? Does that mean this movie deserves a lower score? I believe movies should be judged on their own, as stand alone products. And as a film, this movie is perfect in what it sets out to accomplish.

The movie simply has a fantastic cinematography. Every shot seems thoroughly planned out, and shot as if shooting a frame from a comic book. There are fantastic long shots in this movie, that are not just thrown in as a gimmick, but with a deliberate purpose. Some shots simply hold on a specific perspective. Too few movies seem to understand this classic style. Modern movies constantly cut. Cut, cut cut... -and this is ruining movies. Just hold a shot for a few seconds! Have some patience for crying out loud! And that's what this movie does. It takes its time, and it demands some patience from its audience. You don't need to constantly cut to new camera angles, when you can simply move the camera. And the soundtrack is the final ingredient that makes it all work. It is heroic at times, and also tender and romantic when it needs to. It is in my opinion one of James Newton Howard's best scores.

No, this is not an action movie. It is a slow drama. It is a story that needs to be told slowly. Some may regard this as a flaw. I argue that this movie would not be improved upon by making it faster. It is that slow building atmosphere that makes the movie so good. It is well acted, and it is one of the few movies in which I find Samuel L Jackson totally believable as a character who is not shouting profanities all the time. In fact, this may be one of his best acting roles. Bruce Willis is also fantastic in this. I also feel that not a single line of dialogue is off, or out of place.

Some have called the plot twist predictable. Well, I've seen plenty of people be caught off guard by the twist, myself included, so I see nothing wrong with it. But while the twist is a good way to bookend the movie, I think where the movie really shines is simply the fact that it as a lot of heart. It is sentimental, it is romantic, and it romanticizes the idea of the real life superhero. That is what it is all about, and if you can't embrace that concept, then this movie is simply not for you. There are scenes in this movie that still get the waterworks running, and get me crying man-tears. Call me sentimental, but the movie works for me. Maybe because it touches on a topic that is dear to my heart: The idea of the real life hero.

txt[37]='''M. Night ShyamalanÂ´s The Sixth Sense was a quite impressive piece of psychological suspense. I saw it in a theater and the end really caught me, and everybody else, offguard. Next Shyamalan did Unbreakable and then my favorite of these three movies, Signs. Unbreakable is an above-average thriller/drama, but still I find it somewhat weaker than the Sixth Sense or Signs. And in this case "weaker" isnÂ´t a huge drawback as Unbreakable would still beat 90% of all the so-called psychological thrillers coming out of Hollywood every other second. Only few films manage to create heavy atmospheres and suspenseful moments and even fewer films have talented actors. Bruce Willis might not the greatest actor in Hollywood, but he knows how to do his job well. Samuel L. Jackson is also a very reliable actor and IÂ´m sure that the fact that these two men were both in the third Die Hard movie helped to create the chemistry necessary for movies like this. Unbreakable is a solid dark thriller, but not as good as Signs or The Sixth Sense. I watched this movie dubbed in German (donÂ´t ask me why...) so I might have missed some more or less important points... Oh well. '''

txt[38]='''In the canon of M. Night Shyamalan, movies like "The Sixth Sense", "Signs", and even "Lady in the Water" (provided you view it with the right perspective) can be enjoyed again and again. "Unbreakable" is a little different in that it doesn't hold up quite as well to multiple viewings. However, the first viewing will still provide a mind-bending experience worthy of M. Night.

For a basic plot summary, "Unbreakable" focuses on David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who walks away from a horrible train wreck as the only survivor...and without a scratch on him. After meeting with eccentric comic book dealer "Mr. Glass" (Samuel L. Jackson), David begins to question whether or not that train wreck survival was a "miracle" at all. When he discovers that he has never been sick that he can remember and that he possess certain prognosticative powers, he begins to wonder just who (or what) exactly he might be.

This film is typical M. Night fare in that it weaves a great mystery and gets you thinking all the way through. It isn't a "sit back and pop the popcorn" kind of flick. Instead, it thrives on the viewer using some mental effort and getting caught up in the seemingly impossible tale of David Dunn and Mr. Glass. As such, it might be a bit slow for some viewers, but if you like any of M. Night's other works (or even those type of movies) you'll have no trouble here.

About the only bad thing I have to say about this film is that it is only truly remarkable on the first viewing. After that (unless you have a short memory!) it doesn't hold up quite as well to multiple viewings. The reason? This one is ALL about the mystery, lacking the strong auxiliary characters like "Sixth Sense" or "Signs".

Overall, "Unbreakable" is a fine film that showcases the M. Night mysterious style of film- making. If you are in the mood for a great mind-bending mystery and haven't seen this one before, you are in for a treat. '''

txt[39]='''After more than 10 years of mediocre movies and terrible blockbusters from a Hollywood that seems to have been depleted of imagination, this is an overlooked gem that is refreshing to re-watch. A masterpiece in storytelling, directing and cinematography.

I hope that after "Split" (2017) Shyamalan really does come back and deliver us great movies. We need another year like 2000. By today's standards it seems almost unreal that Requiem for a Dream, Gladiator, American Psycho, Memento, Snatch, Cast Away, What Lies Beneath all came out in the same year. Unbreakable is right there, on the top, with such great movies. '''

txt[40]='''Unbreakable was a movie that was created and written by M. Night Shyamalan and released in the end on 2000. It was again filmed around Pennsylvania like most of his work did such as, The Village and Signs. Some of the major actor or stars would include Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson which they played a total opposite role in the movie. It began with a scene that shows a baby was born but the baby is not like others baby, this baby is born with something "special". If you didn't watch this movie tills the end, you will never understand what's the point of the beginning. After a little backgrounds, of the movie, it begins with the story of a guy named David Dunn (Bruce Willis) riding a train back home which then something tragic happened. Guys pay attention to the present of Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson)'s walking stick, when Elijah falls in one scene the walking stick too drop and shatter like a glass which glasses played a major role in the movie signifies something. Overall, I would say Unbreakable was a pretty decent movie if you love the ideas of super heroes and comic book. But if you love a movie that have lots of stuff happen in it and teaches people a lesson or a moral, this is a great movie. I would rate it as an 8 out of 10 because overall Unbreakable did pretty well, the actors played their rolls pretty accurately which shows us their personalities. Also, the dialogue or plot in the movie was well picked and used in the right scene. Last but no least, I enjoyed watching it.

txt[41]='''Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'.

After a birthday party, three girls, led by Casey, are kidnapped by the troubled Kevin, who has a very rare case of 23 split personalities inside him. What follows is how the three girls try to escape from Kevin who himself is lowly having a mental breakdown. Sorry, I can't tell a lot about this movie as a small factor would spoil it.

This movie couldn't have worked without James McAvoy. He has given his best performance in his whole career and stands out as one of the reasons to watch this movie. The clichÃ© points in the movie are watchable just because of his phenomenal performance. His transition from a 'Norman Bates' type woman Patrica to a 9 year old boy Hedwig to other personalities are amazing

Last but not the least, is the traditional "Shyamalan Twist". Trust me, this time your minds will be blown when you come to the conclusion. This twist doesn't match up to the "The Sixth Sense" one but it's a thrilling one. It's not some stupid twist like in "Signs". I won't forget that moment when someone behind me shouted out "WHAAAAT?!".

"Split" isn't scary, it's tense. This movie shouldn't have been given a "horror" tag. A "psychological thriller" sounds better. Nevertheless, this movie is worth a watch. I'm giving a 8/10 with one extra star just for James McAvoy

Welcome back, M.Night Shyamalan '''

txt[42]='''A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here.

I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge of your seat in more of a suspense mode.

I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all.

This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling.

James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy she's a talent as well.

It's a very exciting film that combines elements of sci-fi, action and thriller to deliver a high octane drama that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout, it seems like a complicated story but once you keep your head with it you will find yourself glued to the screen and following it perfectly, and it's only Stephen Spielberg that can make all these elements work it one movie, though I was not aware he directed it until the closing credits, it made perfect sense to me. The only major flaw I think this movie had is that it stretches out for much too long, it's 2 and half hours and for the last twenty minutes I really felt like it was dragging itself out and it should be over, there were certainly some unnecessary pieces of information that simply overcomplicated the story. The performances are great, the characters are all very flawed and unique and seemed challenging for any actor, thankfully the casting was superb and they all did a great job, particularly Tom Cruise, who plays a man who is strange and suspicious from the beginning, and because of his acting, all we want to do is learn more about him, and that's certainly an important aspect to what made this movie so exciting. Action packed and very intense, I would recommend Minority Report to anyone looking for a good action, thriller or sci-fi film.

The story is about a chief law enforcer who's able to stop crimes before they happen, so there hasn't been a single murder in five years. He thinks everything about the system is perfect, until he's predicted to kill a person he never knew.

The movie has great special effects and action sequences, and none of scenes just go into the "the special effects are so cool that we don't need to tell the story right." The title really isn't a very good title for the movie, but that's all I'm going to say about it.

Tom Cruise also was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).

The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.

The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they actually did?

I recognized two people in here who went on shortly thereafter to become recognizable in TV series: Kathryn Morris ("Cold Case") and Neal McDonough ("Boomtown"). Add Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Samantha Morton and you have an interesting cast. I am of the opinion that this is one of Spielberg's underrated gems. '''

He kidnaps the most powerful pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton) and discovers a flaw in the system. Federal agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is on the manhunt as Anderton tries to prove he's innocent of a crime he's yet to commit.

The concept of free will vs determinism from Philip K. Dick is amazing. The production from Steven Spielberg is terrific. The movie is so well made that it maintains its tension with all the crazy ideas being thrown at the audience. Tom Cruise is the perfect protagonist for this movie. He has a touch of that boy scout with a dark edge. He matches the intensity of the material. There is a good mystery, compelling performances, and expertly made all growing out of a great story. It does wrap up a little too neatly. I'm not sure a Spielberg movie could have gone that dark.

txt[52]='''Spielberg's Minority Report is suspenseful, dramatic, and deliciously grim. The film is well-made; it has incredible visual effects, directing, acting, writing, and just about anything else you can name. I think when it comes to a Spielberg, the work put in it is just of undoubtedly great quality - whether the film turns out to be good or not, or whether one likes the film to begin with. Jurassic Park II or the 4th Indy film, for example, were just decent, but the quality of effort devoted to making both films is extraordinary.

I'm not saying that Minority Report is just decent or anything of the sort. In fact, it is wonderful - perhaps, I've mentioned this. Devotion aside though, it is still of great quality. The story is compelling and provokes some thought. It has a lot of philosophical connotations and could make great conversation. "How much freedom should we have to give up to feel safe?", "Should thinking, planning, or being capable of murder be penalised the same way as murder?" These are some questions that the film makes people ask, and they're rather relevant to contemporary society, too.

Minority Report is a good film, but not great for someone like Spielberg. Compared to Raiders or Schindler's, it's a 6. That's not really a point, though. Minority is good in its own right, and even some amazing films are nothing when mentioned in the same light as Schindler's or Private Ryan. However, compared to some of the crap of the sci-fi genre, Minority is easily an 8 or 9. Again with the comparison! I really have to stop myself from doing that! Anyway, the film's worth a viewing, if not anything more. '''
