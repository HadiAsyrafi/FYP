    <body>The <strong>Lazarus</strong> <strong>effect</strong> <strong>refers</strong> to <strong>semiconductor</strong> <strong>detectors</strong>; when these are used in harsh <strong>radiation</strong> <strong>environments</strong>, <strong>defects</strong> begin to appear in the <strong>semiconductor</strong> crystal <strong>lattice</strong> as <strong>atoms</strong> become displaced because of the <strong>interaction</strong> with the high-energy <strong>traversing</strong> particles. These <strong>defects</strong>, in the <strong>form</strong> of both lattice <strong>vacancies</strong> and <strong>atoms</strong> at interstitial <strong>sites</strong>, have the <strong>effect</strong> of temporarily trapping the <strong>electrons</strong> and <strong>holes</strong> which are created when ionizing <strong>particles</strong> pass through the detector. Since it is these <strong>electrons</strong> and <strong>holes</strong> which drifting under an electric <strong>field</strong> produce a <strong><strong>signal</strong></strong> announcing the <strong>passage</strong> of a <strong>particle</strong>, when large <strong>amounts</strong> of <strong>defects</strong> are produced, detector <strong><strong>signal</strong></strong> can be strongly reduced leading to an unusable (dead) detector. <strong>Radiation</strong> <strong>damage</strong> produced by relativistic <strong>lead</strong> <strong>ions</strong> from the <strong>SPS</strong> <strong>beam</strong> hitting a <strong>silicon microstrip detector</strong> of the <strong>NA50</strong> <strong>experiment</strong> at CERN.</body>
