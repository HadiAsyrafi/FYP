		    <body>This <strong>morning</strong> I had the <strong>chance</strong> to get a <strong>tour</strong> of The <strong>Henry Ford Museum</strong> in <strong>Dearborn</strong>, <strong>MI</strong>, along with <strong>Dale Dougherty</strong>, <strong>creator</strong> of <strong>Make</strong>: and <strong>Make</strong>rfaire, and <strong>Marc Greuther</strong>, the chief <strong>curator</strong> of the museum. I had expected a museum dedicated to the auto industry, but it's so much more than that. As I wrote in my first stunned <strong>tweet</strong>, "it's the <strong>Louvre</strong> of the Industrial Age." When we first entered, <strong>Marc</strong> took us to what he said may be his favorite <strong>artifact</strong> in the <strong>museum</strong>, a <strong>block</strong> of <strong>concrete</strong> that contains <strong>Luther Burbank</strong>'s <strong>shovel</strong>, and <strong>Thomas Edison</strong>'s <strong>signature</strong> and footprints. <strong>Luther Burbank</strong> was, of <strong>course</strong>, the great agricultural <strong>inventor</strong> who created such <strong>treasures</strong> as the <strong>nectarine</strong> and the <strong>Santa Rosa</strong> plum. <strong>Ford</strong> was a <strong>farm boy</strong> who became an <strong>industrialist</strong>; <strong>Thomas Edison</strong> was his <strong>friend</strong> and mentor. The <strong>museum</strong>, opened in 1929, was <strong>Ford</strong>'s personal <strong>homage</strong> to the <strong>transformation</strong> of the <strong>world</strong> that he was so much a part of. This museum chronicles that transformation. The <strong>machines</strong> are astonishing, <strong>steam</strong> <strong>engines</strong> and coal-fired electric <strong>generators</strong> as big as <strong>houses</strong>, the first <strong>lathes</strong> capable of making other <strong>precision</strong> <strong>lathes</strong> (the <strong>makerbot</strong> of the 19th <strong>century</strong>), a <strong>ribbon glass machine</strong> that is one of five that in the 1970s made virtually all of the <strong>incandescent lightbulbs</strong> in the <strong>world</strong>, <strong>combine</strong> <strong>harvesters</strong>, <strong>railroad</strong> <strong>locomotives</strong>, <strong>cars</strong>, <strong>airplanes</strong>, even <strong>motels</strong>, <strong>gas</strong> <strong>stations</strong>, an early <strong>McDonalds</strong>' <strong>restaurant</strong> and other <strong>epiphenomena</strong> of the automobile era. Under <strong>Marc</strong>'s <strong>eye</strong>, we also saw the <strong>transformation</strong> of the <strong>machines</strong> from purely functional <strong>objects</strong> to <strong>things</strong> of beauty. We saw the <strong>advances</strong> in <strong>engineering</strong>, the <strong>materials</strong>, the <strong>workmanship</strong>, the <strong>design</strong>, over a hundred <strong>years</strong> of innovation. Visiting The Henry Ford, as they call it, is a truly humbling experience. I would never in a hundred <strong>years</strong> have thought of making a <strong><strong>visit</strong></strong> to <strong>Detroit</strong> just to <strong><strong>visit</strong></strong> this <strong>museum</strong>, but knowing what I know now, I will tell you confidently that it is as worth your while as a <strong><strong>visit</strong></strong> to <strong>Paris</strong> just to see the <strong>Louvre</strong>, to <strong>Rome</strong> for the <strong>Vatican Museum</strong>, to <strong>Florence</strong> for the <strong>Uffizi Gallery</strong>, to <strong>St. Petersburg</strong> for the <strong>Hermitage</strong>, or to <strong>Berlin</strong> for the Pergamon Museum. This is truly one of the <strong>world</strong>'s great <strong>museums</strong>, and the <strong>world</strong> that it chronicles is our own. I am truly humbled that the <strong>Museum</strong> has partnered with us to hold <strong>Makerfaire Detroit</strong> on their grounds. If you are anywhere in <strong>reach</strong> of <strong>Detroit</strong> this <strong>weekend</strong>, I heartily recommend that you plan to spend both days there. You can easily spend a <strong><strong>day</strong></strong> at <strong>Makerfaire</strong>, and you could easily spend a <strong><strong>day</strong></strong> at The Henry Ford.</body>
